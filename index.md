## Welcome

Welcome to the OWASP Chandigarh Chapter! We are a dynamic group of students passionate about cybersecurity and dedicated to enhancing application security in our region. Our chapter serves as a platform for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and skill development, bringing together individuals from various backgrounds to discuss the latest trends and challenges in the field of cybersecurity.

## Participation

The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation focused on improving software security. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are freely accessible to anyone interested in advancing application security.

We host events both offline and online, providing opportunities for individuals to engage with our community. We welcome speakers and sponsors to reach out and contribute to our initiatives. For more information on how to get involved, please refer to the About Us section.

Everyone is encouraged to participate in our Projects, Local Chapters, Events, Online Groups, and Community Slack Channel. We especially value diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is an excellent place to learn about application security, network with peers, and build your reputation as an expert in the field. We also invite you to become a member or consider making a donation to support our ongoing efforts.

Join us in our mission to create a safer digital environment for all!
