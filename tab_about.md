## About OWASP

The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security. 

## About Us

We are a dedicated group of individuals, committed to promoting and enhancing application security within our community. As part of the global OWASP initiative, our chapter aims to provide a platform for knowledge sharing, collaboration, and skill development in the field of cybersecurity.

Our chapter organizes regular meetups, workshops, and events that bring together industry experts, researchers, and students to discuss the latest trends, challenges, and best practices in application security. We believe in fostering a supportive environment where individuals can learn from one another, share their experiences, and grow their skills.
